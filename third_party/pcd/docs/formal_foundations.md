# Formal Foundations

The most effective way to provide guarantee that the codebase is correct and indeed makes the data analysis tasks policy compliant, we utilize the technique of formal verification. By abstracting the framework using formal specifications, we reason about the desired properties and give formal proofs thereof. We aim to formally verify the correctness of our framework so that users will gain more confidence that their data privacy would not be harmed by the data collector.

The formal part is still under development.
